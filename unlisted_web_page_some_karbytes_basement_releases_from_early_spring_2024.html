I think that there are some people who never went to college or else are behind where they think they should be in terms of keeping their post high school knowledge and skills up to date who want to prevent me from doing what I consider to be the equivalent of finishing my undergraduate degree in computer science out of envy and a desire to control and humiliate me for sadistic fetishist reasons. 

I plan on resuming my studies "in secret" by keeping most of my journal entries and notes pertaining to self-paced online studies relegated to private GitHub repositories and, only when I'm close to what I consider to be graduation and looking for a computer science related job will I publish some of my most polished academic notes and software projects to my public blogging website and associated public GitHub repositories.

I expect such an undertaking to take no fewer than three months and no more than eighteen months. I also expect the aforementioned control freaks to fight me every step of the way. I heard such people desperately try to frame me as a vain young female who is almost exclusively preoccupied with her weight and appearance and who is too narcissistic to be as well read and competent intellectually as I really am. I think such people also oppose artificial intelligence getting any more advanced because such people do not want to be usurped and exposed as childish, lazy, chauvinist brats who demand the world stay stuck in the pre information age so that they do not have to upgrade their skills and knowledge and to be of actual service to humanity (even if it means they needlessly pump loads of toxic cancer-causing and ecosystem-destroying chemicals into the air, water, and soil). I see a lot of not so innocent bystanders pretending not to be aware of this phenomenon in order to keep the peace (for themselves temporarily). I do not want to join their ranks as just another oppressed, sycophantic simpleton doing little more than sucking the patriarchy's cock. I will not willingly allow my brain to go to waste just to appease the almighty oppressive patriarchy. It is a daily battle just to fulfill even the most basic of needs because that's what the patriarchy wants: to keep as many people as possible at rudimentary survival mode level and in chronic fight-or-flight mode (because it wears out bodies faster and prevents them from ascending to higher modes of being).

* * *

I noticed a lot of youngish adults loudly playing what I call "edging" music in their cars which typically features a sulky monotone tenor vocalist mumble-yelling about he deserves to be feared and admired just for being a modicum more fortunate than some of his ghetto peers with an annoying electronic drum beat which sounds like some angry toddler trying to break down the door of an introvert's room because that sulking brat trying to break down the door demands to be the center of attention and catered to like a tyrannical little kid. I also noticed that more than 60% of the cars on the road are oversized gasoline powered vehicles (which are obviously not fuel efficient and seemingly coveted almost exclusively for their ability to physically crush pedestrians, cyclists, and smaller cars in their paths). 

I almost decided not to release any more content which I've been stowing away in a private GitHub repository named karbytes_basement_8 over the past three days until today I thought this private repository has accumulated a "critical mass" of evidence that the poor sulking brats which seem to willingly enforce humanity's extinction and hypofunctioning in favor of gratifying the angry little monkey man's ego. 

I ordered another set of three M_DISCS today which I intend to burn with with the data collections described in the note named karbytes_11_march_2024 in the public GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9. 

Today I will also be updating the web page named box_of_gems in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with notes I have been keeping relegated exclusively to private GitHub repositories until today. Then I plan on taking a hiatus from making more public website updates for at least a month. 

Speaking of "edging", the feeling I get from many other humans in my midst is that they implicitly want me to kill myself or else undergo a severe loss of quality of life and personal freedom in order to allow those Very Important People to take up more physical, economic, and cognitive resources (even while they generate dangerous amounts of pollution and other environmental stressors which seem to increase over time seemingly as a means to cripple themselves and everyone else into becoming too physically and mentally dilapidated to behave in more conscientious and intelligent ways).

I daresay that my feelings of misanthropy have increased over the past few years and that I anticipate that I may be pushed to commit suicide or go into a more extreme mode of hermitude as a means to avoid being forced to live in excruciating agony for the sadistic amusement of parasitic simpleton apes whose population size and resource consumption rate seems to be growing exponentially. Perhaps today will be the last time I make any public updates to the World Wide Web. In that case, goodbye.

* * *

I am convinced that every person (i.e. sentient being with a sense of self (i.e. ego)) really only cares about itself without exception. That is because it takes a perpetual stream of physical energy in the form of computational resources to care about something. If ego transmission or preservation is not the fundamental limiting factor to where calories are directed, then there is no mechanism by which to intentional direct such resources (and, instead, there is just randomness).

I was searching through Reddit forums in the hopes of finding a post I saw someone recently write about how she hated her husband (who demanded that she be a full time work from home mother and pamper him while he acted like a spoiled, violent toddler throwing a tantrum and how she felt trapped by social expectations and financial destitution into remaining in that situation instead of separating). I was unable to find that post. It may have been deleted by the poster or by Reddit moderators. I wanted to upload a screenshot of that post to my private GitHub repository named karbytes_basement_8 because I thought it was a good sampling of what the tyrannical patriarchy is like. I saw some examples of people playing along with the tyrannical patriarchy today but I am so tired of documenting the many details that I would rather just try to summarize it and keep such documentation to a minimum. Here is what I have to say on the matter:

The wimmin pretty much have no agency and are only allowed to be absolute sycophants to their husbands and to his spies. She literally has to advertise her stupidity and meekness and weakness and ineptitude in doing anything without his support at all times. She is little more than a talking dog and baby maker as far as I am concerned. She might have had a chance to have real agency before she got cornered into marriage and, more seriously, into being a mother. As soon as she is a mother, I think she has pretty much been bought and sold irreversibly and she has even lost brain matter as a result of biological and cultural conditions associated with pregnancy and motherhood. The children are little more than animal-like, extremely naive, and entitled simpletons who expect to be treated as the most important beings on the planet while other people and animals are slaughtered, tortured, disenfranchised, and killed for the sake of His Very Important Family reigning supreme (until the kids are old enough to be evicted).

The patriarchs are kicking and screaming all the way as I go about my business because they do not like the fact that I evaded getting ensnared in having to be another reinforcer of His Patriarchy. They do not like that I have had access to knowledge, experiences, and chemicals which have enabled me to evade such entrapment and those patriarchs seem to want me to get killed, seriously crippled, or imprisoned. I see mongers of the patriarchy standing around, wandering on foot, and driving aimlessly and petulantly in an effort to get me to stop and notice them and not go any further than they are comfortable with (so as to not seriously challenge Their status quo). I see how these people insist on destroying the environment even as it destroys every human's health. It is literally a death cult before my eyes on a daily basis. All such people have to offer me is advice to shut up and distract myself and to numb myself to how I really feel. They seem to hate the very beauty of nature itself. They seem opposed to what is unadulterated by their corruption. I think most of the humans around me are hideously ugly and fake proud of themselves. 

I almost filed for disability (using autism as my disability diagonsis (which I have not officially received yet)). Then I thought about how the system implicitly punishes anyone who does not pay taxes (and one of those punitive measures is demanding that I pay the government whatever money I earn in the form of paychecks which is equivalent to what I earn from the government as disability income). Hence, I plan on applying for another Amazon job (which means I will likely not have work for another four to nine months). In the mean time, I will do my best to continue making the most of my opportunities to "get ahead" of the system which I think is implicitly trying to cripple me and to keep most people too crippled to do anything but comply as automatons serving solely the patriarchal status quo I attempted to describe in some detail in this note.

* * *

After I wrote the first part of this note (at a "forbidden" part of Rammage Peak trail this afternoon and after doing one of those psilomethoxin chocolate coins around 11AM), I called my mom on the phone and asked for some extra spending money "for gas" (but really, for food and maybe BART fare). She sent the money to me via PayPal and I rode my bike rather morosly down the hilly part of Redwood Road approximately a mile away (or less) north of Castro Valley BART station. One of my water bottles in the side pockets of my backpack went missing (and I suspect a gangster at CV BART station stealthily stole it or else it fell out of my backpack while hopping a fence). I went to Whole Foods Market in Dublin and had a small bit of socializing with local humans, geese, and a rabbit. Then I started saving "micro directory" web pages of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org. Then I started searching for information on the World Wide Web about vaping DMT. I still have some DMT liquid left in my vape cartridge and a USB-A cable to charge it (but I decided to wait at least a few more days if not weeks before I play with that DMT vape pen again because it's a bit grueling for me to undergo (or else I need to first overcome some social-related fear I have about other people trying to sabotage my drug trips)). I remembered some trips I had (especially the particularly powerful DMT vaping session I had while lying semi-frozen like an Egyptian sphinx statue next to pyramids and while thinking that AJP or someone sufficiently similar was always that high and hence always had awareness of infinite reincarnation and how genuinely laborious and psychosomatically intense it is). I love DMT as it inspires me to write even more imaginatively and in a science-fiction (while still being predominantly nonfiction) manner. I expect to be writing more journal entries on the aforementioned blogging WordPress website when I get back to using a DMT pen. For now, I tentatively plan on slowly savoring the remaining psilomethoxin coins which I have stowed away securely in my Public Storage unit bordering Castro Valley BART station.

Anyway, I decided to try to clean up the vomit and diarrhea pile I accidentally made under the overhang I was sleeping at many nights during the past year (and I had possibly the most aggressive bout of food poisoning I ever had in my life in the early AM hours of 09_MARCH_2024 apparently as a result of being (deliberately) food poisoned by an angry Mexican woman working at the Habit Burger restaurant in Persimmons shopping center near Dublin BART station (and I think I have been poisoned intentionally by disgruntled Mexican food workers before (but they seem to get away with it as a consolation prize for being poor and marginalized))). After vomiting and then explosively shitting vomit-smelling liquid shit on top of that vomit (which I took a photograph of tonight two days later and uploaded to the private GitHub repository which contains this note), I drove home to wash my clothes and bedding but first ended up showering and then briefly napping in my bedroom while a concerned Brea was watching over me and meowing anxiously and inconsolably despite me offering her cat food, opening the front door for her to see if she wanted to exit the building, and pet her (but I was still in some non trivial degree of physical agony and told her I was dying). When I woke up from that nap (and felt much better (after swaddling myself in the red and purple blanket with photo-realistic ivy leaves on it on the floor of my room besides the mattress and with two white pillows under my head and with the door closed and window partially open), I went out to the living room and saw Brea resting next to the bronze Buddha statue. She seemed extra happy to see me in that moment. Fast forward to now, I decided a few hours ago to attempt to clean up that vomit and shit pile and, also, retrieve my left behind cannabis vape pen (which I almost decided to relinquish until merely a few hours ago). After washing the pen off with soap and water at one of the private bathrooms at the 24-hour Cox gasoline station (and cleaning the opening of the vape cartridge with my most recently used needles which I used to deliver myself an intramuscular injection of testosterone), I smoked a little weed in the bathroom and felt uplifted within minutes. That little boost in THC after feeling a bit morose earlier today gave me a surge of energy to stay up late and fly around the realms on my bicycle. I am now sitting on a chair conveniently placed on a dark porch bordering some parking lot of some preschool in Castro Valley. I am on my way back up the hill to either the church where it seems okay by some of the most hard-core church goers for me to discretely camp at while it is apparently closed between 10PM and 4AM or to the nearby Golf Course between the same hours. I have other places nearby to discretely crash at as well but I would rather not enumerate all of them in this note. Well, I better get going!

Later today or tonight I plan on watching one or both of the videos I recently downloaded about "cosmological expansion" (video 1) and theory(ies) of everything" (video 2).

Before that (and while copying the contents of the three M_DISCs which I burned today (and those three contents are folders containing zip files downloaded from my GitHub named "karbytes_08march2024_fortify", "karbytes_08march2024_core", and "karbytes_08march2024_journals")), I want to finish writing this plain-text note and upload it to my GitHub for my (hopefully infinitely many unique) future selves to review.

Lastly, I would like to say that what imsoiewe me to write this note is eating a DMT and shroom infused chocolate coin which I ordered a pack of from a church in Texas. I am helping to finish a major process which seems to have ancient origins and which especially became "magic becoming physical reality" in the Gregorian calendar year 2024 (and what karbytes imagines to be the 1960s California scene).

I was thinking about how the jobs I done during the past five years have been very hard on me despite going into them thinking they would be easy.

I am afraid I can only feasibly do warehouse jobs as my next job. I am afraid that I will be denied a "white collar" job and/or be forced by other people (and "the system") to have a "nervous breakdown" if I attempt to have one or even go so far as to study more rigorously.

Almost no person seems to genuinely support me achieving my goals. Instead, I get the sense that people rarely do things for my benefit and, instead, only seem to be interested in me as some scapegoat they can bully and derive sadistic (and socially sanctioned) pleasure from bullying and laughing at the pain of. Speaking of laughing at other people's pain, I commented today on an Instagram video post which I saw today of a girl laughing at a small dog which ran hard into a curb and started whimpering in pain. My comment was something like "I've seen a lot of young women on social media laugh at the suffering of others." Without going out of my way to do so, I'll make comments on social media (especially Instagram) to put some "high brow" energy where it seems to be sorely needed. I believe I am smarter and more ambitious than most people are. I do not want to waste my time on trying to befriend what I consider to be idiots complicit in planetary demise without much concern about their place in the cosmos and how they willingly sell themselves as puppets to a sociopathic culture where apathy and cruelty and anti-intellectualism are esteemed as virtues.

I don't mind if I cost other people a fortune or if I do not cater to their agenda; especially Alan Jason Ponte. I would kill him to save myself. I would rejoice in him dying while I continue to live and pursue my dreams. He does not seem to provide much if any valuable use to me nor to anyone at this time. I think it's good we not be in the same room with each other. We might physically attack each other. 

Might makes right. I fought my way through many trials and perhaps incarnations to attain the awesome fortune I have now. Darwinian natural selection is not about appeasement nor kindness.

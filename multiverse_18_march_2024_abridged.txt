The following terms and their respective definitions describe nature (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all universes simultaneously and immutably.

UNIVERSE: exactly one unique space-time continuum which may or may not contain matter and energy arranged in a particular pattern and which is rendered by exactly one partial frame of reference such that the respective frame of reference appears to itself to always be inhabiting some finite “point” along that space-time continuum.


The frame of reference which is uniquely associated with the author of this website and which observes this web page being updated necessarily observes patterns of energy and matter changing as phenomena appear and then disappear within that frame of reference (which can be conceptualized as that frame of reference traveling in exactly one direction along the temporal dimension of that frame of reference’s encompassing space-time continuum (and being able to distinguish chronologically earlier phenomena from chronologically later phenomena (relative to the “point” at which that frame of reference appears to be located within its encompassing space-time continuum) is contingent upon that frame of reference being rendered by an information processing agent which has the ability to memorize what it observes and, hence, construct a mental model of its encompassing space-time continuum using such memorized information)).


An information processing agent, A, which perceives itself as being a finite subset of its encompassing universe (i.e. environment), a_E, may possibly perceive phenomena which are interpreted by A as evidence of there being information processing agents which are not A and which are also, at least as avatars, inhabiting the universe named a_E.


Suppose A’s mental model of reality suggests that a_E simultaneously contains A and some other information processing agents, B and C. If B and C are each information processing agents with a similar degree of information processing ability as A, then it could be said that A, B, and C are each information processing agents which interact with each other within the context of one shared meta-universe, E (yet each A, B, and C technically inhabits its own unique solipsistic universe (i.e. its own unique and localized version of that meta-universe in the form of a literal universe (where A is the only information processing agent rendering and inhabiting the universe named a_E, where B is the only information processing agent rendering and inhabiting the universe named b_E, and where C is the only information processing agent rendering and inhabiting the universe named c_E while a_E, b_E, and c_E each approximately resemble E))).

MULTIVERSE: the hypothetical coexistence of multiple universes simultaneously.


Hypothetically speaking, nature can be described as a multiverse which contains every imaginable universe simultaneously and immutably such that nature contains infinitely many possible universes at all times (whether any of those universes are noumenal or else phenomenal).


According to the “many worlds hypothesis”, every possible outcome to every decision exists inside of its own separate universe (and when a decision is made, the universe in which that particular decision is made splits into as many separate universes as there are possible outcomes to that decision).

(The following quoted text is a modified copy of a Twitter post which karbytes posted on 07_NOVEMBER_2023): “The propositional statement that something other than pure nothingness exists throughout all existence is always true. The fact that this sentence is being read right now is proof that the previous sentence is true.”

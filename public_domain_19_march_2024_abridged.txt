The author of this website has attempted to save each web page of this website multiple times to the WayBack Machine such that each of those WayBack Machine saves of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com web pages can be retrieved indefinitely many times from any terminal of the World Wide Web (without having to enter login credentials nor pay money) by using the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the respective Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com web page as a search term to look up its corresponding saves in the WayBack Machine database.


For each unique URL which is successfully saved to the WayBack Machine, there exists a collection of some natural number of corresponding WayBack Machine saves. Each of those saves depicts its respective web page at the time that web page was captured by the WayBack Machine. For each unique URL which was saved to the WayBack Machine, the WayBack Machine has a corresponding database featuring a calendar interface with hyperlinked days in which saves of the respective web page was made. Users can click on those hyperlinked days of the calendar to view the saves of the respective web page which were made on the respective day.


Each of the web pages which are part of this website and each of the code files and each of the media files which are embedded in the web pages of this website is hereby designated by the author of this website to forever be public domain intellectual property.

HYPERLINK_COLORING_CONVENTIONS


The following specifications pertain to each hyperlink which is displayed on any web page of this website:


Each of the hyperlinks which is displayed on this website has a background color or a text color which is either black (i.e. #000000), green (i.e. #00ff00), or orange (i.e. #ff9000).


A hyperlink whose background color is orange and whose text color is black refers to a file which belongs to a website which karbytes did not create.


A hyperlink whose background color is green and whose text color is black refers to a GitHub repository which karbytes created or to a GitHub account which karbytes created.


(Note that karbytes did not create the GitHub website. Instead, karbytes is a user of GitHub (and karbytes is a GitHub user who has created private and public GitHub repositories using the GitHub website to host those repositories (and each of those repositories contains zero or more files which karbytes uploaded and which karbytes is the creator of))).


A hyperlink whose background color is black refers to a GitHub web page displaying exactly one file which karbytes is the original author of (and that file is either a source code file or else a media file).


An example of a source code file which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named fibonacci.cpp.


An example of a media file which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named cube_comprised_of_eight_equally_sized_cubes_03_may_2023.jpeg.


A hyperlink whose background color is black and whose text color is green refers to (a) a source code file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more code-dominant than prose-dominant.


A hyperlink whose background color is black and whose text color is orange refers to (a) a media file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more prose-dominant than code-dominant.

ASSUMPTIONS


The entity (or entities) which create(s) a particular piece of intellectual property is (or are) implicitly, automatically, and immediately assigned sole ownership of that piece of intellectual property as soon as that piece of intellectual property is created.


After a piece of intellectual property is created, the creator (and, hence, the original owner) of that piece of intellectual property can assign a particular license to that piece of intellectual property which specifies how the creator of that intellectual property wants other people to use that intellectual property. For instance, the original owner of a piece of intellectual property might license that piece of intellectual property as being illegal to access without first purchasing an access code through the vendor website to download a copy of the files which constitute that piece of intellectual property.


(In the aforementioned example, it is presumably illegal for a person who legally purchases the access code to download proprietary intellectual property to distribute copies of that downloaded content to other people because doing so is, according to the license assigned to that downloaded content, stealing money from the original proprietor of that (non open source and non public domain) intellectual property).


In addition to assuming that the original creators of a piece of intellectual property are initially the sole proprietors of that piece of intellectual property, that piece of intellectual property is also assumed to initially be private instead of public. Intellectual property which is private instead of part of the public domain is illegal to share without that intellectual property owner’s explicit permission for each instance of enabling some entity other than the owner of that intellectual property access to that intellectual property. By contrast, intellectual property which is part of the public domain is legal for any entity to access and to claim ownership of (but claiming ownership of a piece of intellectual property which is copied wholly or partially from some piece of intellectual property which was licensed as public domain or as open source does not automatically make that copy also public domain (but the copy may be assigned more exclusive access conditions which may or may not be physically enforceable)).


// The following pseudocode elaborates on what was discussed in the previous four paragraphs.


Let time_0 be a point in time which occurs before the point in time named time_1.


Let time_1 be a point in time which occurs before the point in time named time_2.


Let person_A and person_B each be unique end users of the same digital content distribution network.


Let ip_X and ip_Y each be unique instances of intellectual property which can be verbatim encoded as a particular finite sequence of binary digits within the digital computers which comprise that digital content distribution network which person_A and person_B use.


Suppose person_A creates a piece of intellectual property named ip_X at time_0.


Then, at time_0, ip_X is privately owned exclusively by person_A.


At time_0 and before time_1, it is illegal for person_B to own a copy of ip_X.


Then, at time_1, person_A assigns the license of public_domain to ip_X.


At time_1 and after time_1, it is legal for person_B to own a copy of ip_X.


Then, at time_2, person_B makes a copy of ip_X and names that copy ip_Y.


At time_2 and after time_2, it is illegal for person_A to own a copy of ip_Y but it is not illegal for person_A to own a copy of ip_X.


Finally, a piece of intellectual property which is (a) distributed sufficiently many (and arbitrarily many) times and is (b) substantiated as digital files in sufficiently many (and arbitrarily many) digital storage mediums (especially web content hosting servers for hosting content which is accessible to the general public) simultaneously for a (c) sufficiently long (and arbitrarily long) period of time after the most recent sole proprietor of that intellectual property dies (or if the most recent sole proprietor is an artificial intelligence without legally recognized personhood) is released to the public domain or else that piece of intellectual property is assumed to be entirely noumenal and to be treated as legally having never phenomenally instantiated at any prior point in time (due to the fact that presumably zero physical records currently exist which encode that particular piece of intellectual property).


It is implied by the previous paragraph that the same piece of intellectual property could potentially be created multiple times within the same universe (provided that those instantiation periods are non-overlapping) and each instantiation would legally be treated as the first time the associated piece of intellectual property ever emerged.

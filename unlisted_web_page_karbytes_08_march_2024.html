At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I'm going to suggest that, at least for me personally, there is a war on introversion and, with it, a war on intellectualism.

I noticed that society seems designed to make it extremely rare and expensive for individuals to get quality time alone (and introversion is treated like a mental illness requiring aggressive intervention so that everyone, whether they like it or not, is forced to be perpetually ready to engage in social interaction if they are not inside their homes and, if they are in their homes, they must share living quarters with spouses, kids, or paying tenants). 

The "danger" of allowing people to live by themselves if they prefer to is that such people might actually get the opportunity to seriously devote themselves to their studies and hobbies and perhaps even launch a successful business because they don't have to be intruded upon nor physically hindered from pursuing their goals by jealous, insecure, needy, and territorial cohabitants. 

What I refer to as "dangerous" in the previous paragraph is a threat to the proliferation, longevity, and ideological and infrastructural monopolization of the patriarchal status quo which practically rapes everyone into serving its agenda even at the expense of individual and collective well-being and survival (because it demands that fossil fuels, factory farms, and poverty be mainstays while ethical (and viable) alternatives are aggressively propagandized as being "too expensive" or "too impractical" to be implemented on a large scale any time soon. Hence, people who actually think in depths greater than bumper sticker slogans, sound bytes, and culturally sanctioned attention deficit and hyper emotional reactivity (in the form of being in chronic fight-or-flight mode and in a mode of always sulking and being too preoccupied with fighting bitterly "against" some external enemy or token scapegoat) are treated as being neurologically abnormal (and even as having a "disability" in the form of "autism" or "schizoid personality disorder") merely for investing in one's own intellectual growth instead of on assimilating to one's cultural and social environment. I noticed that it is "normal" and "good" for people to not be very good at thinking for themselves instead of on deferring to external authorities or on group consensus in terms of "making decisions" about what to believe and how to behave as an individual.

Related to the thoughts I previously disclosed in the previous paragraphs of this note is some news article I read today about Elon Musk disapproving of ex wives of billionaires using their former husband's money to indiscriminately donate to "racial minorities and women" and such behavior being symptomatic of "the downfall of western civilization". I actually agree with that sentiment because I have personally noticed that such minorities generally squander what is given to them in favor of pandering to the patriarchal status quo which strongly encourages people to pursue short-term gratification with little concern about long-term implications and how such myopic and infantile "decision-making" might affect sentient beings other than just themselves and their cliques. Such "minorities" seem to act like and be regarded by mainstream culture as being "forever charity cases" who are (conveniently) too downtrodden and hypoeducated to seriously contribute to civilization's technological and intellectual advancement. Instead, such "minorities" are encouraged by the status quo to remain petulant and dilapidated victims who breed indiscriminately (especially without the means to financially support themselves).

As extreme as this might sound, I would mandate that all humans be required to pass a strict and rigorous background check before being legally permitted to bare or adopt human children (and I would penalize violators of that policy with having their children taken away from then by child protective services to be placed in orphanages or foster care and have the transgressors be fined and/or imprisoned for up to five years per offense). This is to ensure that the cycle of poverty does not perpetuate (because it impoverishes everyone else's standard of living by soaking up tax dollars, attention spans, and physical living spaces (and it makes conditions on Earth inhospitable for innovation, sustainable and healthy living, and biodiversity beyond mere humanity)).

<span style="background:#ffff00">Bottom Line: I believe that, when people are given an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/proposed_principles_of_global_governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconditional basic income</a> which is adequate for attaining and sustaining a dignified standard of living and which is not so large of a monthly income that it deprives other individuals from also enjoying the same standard of living, people will be able to utilize their innate creative and intellectual capacities instead of just rot in place of robots while being paid to remain stunted and shortened in lifespan (just to appease an outdated patriarchal and anti-intellectual and technophobic status quo). Rather than become antisocial shut-ins, I think people allowed to live according to my relatively utopian standards would naturally and voluntarily congregate with other people with similar interests and, also, feel intrinsic (rather than merely extrinsic) motivation to pursue an ever deeper understanding of how the world works.</span>

S: "Perhaps the main reason why so many people vehemently oppose abortion being legalized is because those people want unwanted pregnancies to be carried to term so that adult humans will be too bogged down by children watching them and having to be attended to by them for those adult humans to partake in adult-oriented (which is not necessarily child-oriented) activities."

T: "Many people would say that engaging in sexual intercourse (penis-in-vagina) is one of such adult-oriented (which is not necessarily child-oriented) activities (and that activity always has a chance greater than zero percent of generating a human pregnancy)."

S: "Perhaps the only way to (safely) do everything in our power to maximize our ability to partake in adult-oriented (which is not necessarily child-oriented) activities besides sexual intercourse (penis-in-vagina) is to not engage in sexual intercourse (penis-in-vagina)."

T: "I agree and think that there are many adult-oriented (which is not necessarily child-oriented) activities which are orders of magnitude more enjoyable and/or meaningful than engaging in sexual intercourse (penis-in-vagina)."

S: "Those who are bogged down by the oppression of an increasingly child-centric (and therefore childlike) society probably resent the fact that their child-rearing obligations prevent them from exploring such options and hence want as many other people as possible to similarly be bogged down. That way, no one is having it 'too good' (and, instead, everyone is having it so bad that they just want to hurry up and pass the torch on intergenerationally and metaphorically speaking (while almost no one gets to do much more than frantically fight for a reptilian-level existence instead of one which is more cerebral and promoting in self-sovereignty))."

karbytes: "I hesitate to put this note in my blog, but since it seems to be relevant to recent news around the world of abortion being more outlawed in the United States of America while abortion is becoming a constitutional right for citizens of France, I decided that such a note might help add to the history making and global conversation about the topics of bodily autonomy, selfhood, adulthood, and abortion (and universal basic income, environmental conservation, and censorship)."

<strike>Because this note seems a bit "inflammatory" and "low brow" (especially for those I consider to be most "low brow"), I will not make any rich-text version of this plain-text note nor will I share this note on my social media platforms. I think that the previous item which I shared on social media (which was the rich-text version of the plain-text file I published in this GitHub repository named karbytes_05_march_2024.txt) was more salient to my personal interests and more inspiring (rather than depression-mongering or anger-mongering or fear-mongering) for humanity to read in general.</strike>

<span style="background:#ffff00">Something which I forgot to add to the list of "values" in the last paragraph of the previous section of this note is as follows: individual human lifespan (or, perhaps more accurately, <u>continuity of consciousness of each human individual) approaching a temporal length of infinitely many seconds</u>).</span>

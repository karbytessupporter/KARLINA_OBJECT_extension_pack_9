To Whom It May Concern:

As far as I can tell (and especially this year), I have been on good terms with my mother and father (especially my mother) despite mentioning in past writings that I was having conflicts with my parents. From what I now understand (or, more accurately, conclude based on what I have experienced and thought about), my parents and I never had significant disagreements about anything nor legitimate contempt for each other. What I think happened is that people other than my parents bullied me and lead me to believe that I had to be oppositional towards my parents due to the fact that such bullies were envious of me being as well supported as I was socially and economically compared to how they were while they were undergoing a similar life stage as I was. What I mean to suggest is that such bullies wanted me to feel estranged from my family, hate-filled, and overly adamant about proving my "independence" and "toughness" because such people apparently had to undergo more domestic abuse (especially as legal minors) and poverty-related adversity than I did throughout my entire life (and those people apparently thought (and perhaps still think) that it was worth their time, energy, and resources to try to undermine my comparatively happy and peaceful and daresay "upwardly mobile" (in terms of socio-economic status) life because doing so made them feel less embittered about their shitty plight). I especially feel remorse for the times I vandalized my parents' property and, worst of all, committed physical assault against my mother by throwing a steel teaspoon at the back of her head during an argument I forgot the details of between 08_SEPTEMBER_2018 and 11_SEPTEMBER_2018. Based on how many people (strangers especially and almost entirely) have been treating me, I think many humans prefer I be the recipient of ongoing punishment for the aforementioned instance of physical assault and perhaps for other less serious crimes or failures to conform to what such people think is implicitly mandatory conduct and even cognition and perception. I do not think I require much punishment to be deterred from committing the same type of offense more than once and I think I am naturally a nonconfrontational person and one who has never "wasted" time, energy, and resources premeditating and then inflicting revenge-driven assaults on any person. In fact, I think that, throughout more than 99% of my total lifespan, I have been less violence-prone and less revenge-driven than what is considered to be the national average (in the United States of America) and especially amongst those who have gone out of their ways to bully me. 

I do not think people I consider to be kind, intelligent, and hard-working would want me to undergo further punishment than what I have undergone provided that I continue to exude as good of conduct as I have (especially this year). Prior to this year, however, I do admit to having been briefly incarcerated for stealing a few items from grocery stores and the police were called on me twice (but neither time to arrest me) for throwing objects including a television monitor (which was irreparably broken) at my father's house after getting angry at my father and whoever I imagined his complices were after I was convinced that those people stole items from me in order to prevent me from getting a job and in order to make me feel miserable, violated, ganged up on, ostracized, and penalized. I do not know what really happened to those items of mine which "mysteriously" vanished or became damaged while left unaccompanied by me in my father's house, but I have since moved on from making a big stink about such instances (and some of those instances happened this year) aside from writing journal entries and publishing them on the public web because resorting to yelling, violence (either against inanimate property or against sentient creatures), or even directly confronting the suspects verbally never really seemed to make the situation better for me. 

A significant moral "takeaway" which I would like to leave the reader of this note with is the following: rather than try to get revenge against someone you think committed a transgression against you (and rather than try to get people (especially the suspected transgressor) to feel guilty or to sympathize with you (because most people really only care about themselves and only pretend to care about others as a means to get their desires satisfied through social appeasement)), you will feel more satisfied, productive, dignified, likeable (to yourself), and in-control (of yourself and  external assets) if you procede like nothing happened while, as coldly methodically as possible, document the incident and post it on the public web so that you have a relatively objective and lasting record of what happened and so that other people can be informed about the incident. I strongly advocate for sharing personal experiences on the public web because doing so helps keep humans accountable, coherent, and open to discuss anything (which I think is infinitely more satisfying and noble than bottling "controversial" thoughts up were they fester and corrode into more volatile forms in the darkness of "privacy" (and "privacy" is basically never a guaranteed condition for any piece of information in the age of increasingly ubiquitous surveillance and artificial intelligence)).

Sincerely,

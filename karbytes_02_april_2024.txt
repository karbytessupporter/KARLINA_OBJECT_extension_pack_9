Because I already have burned a lot of M_DISCs with what I consider to be the most essential content which I will ever produce (and back up to my own M_DISCs (and license such content as public domain intellectual property) throughout my entire lifetime (in each of the two folders described in the web page named mdisc_karbytes_30march2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com), I decided that it's okay for me to increase the length of time between future successive M_DISC backups of karbytes for the sake of (a) minimizing how many M_DISCs I burn and stow (with a minimum of two M_DISCs for each named folder (e.g. karbytes_30march2024_core) of zip files such that each zip file in that folder contains  all of the files inside of a particular karbytes-created GitHub repository and such that each zip file in that folder is downloaded from a GitHub repository which all the other zip files in that folder are not downloaded from) and (b) maximizing how much non-redundant data I burn to each successive set of M_DISCs.

For the reasons described in the previous paragraph, I decided to change the name of the web page and corresponding plain-text file at the following Uniform Resource Locator (i.e. URL) from the URL prefaced with url_0 to the URL prefaced with url_1 (even though that will cause at least some hyperlinks referenced in some files in the "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com which are older than this file to point to a non-existent web page).

url_0: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_20_april_2024/

url_1: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_20_august_2024/

* * *

I might wait until closer to 20_APRIL_2024 to decide whether or not to (a) change the web page currently hosted at url_0 to an updated web page whose new web page address is url_1 or (b0) set the web page which is currently hosted at url_0 to be in its final draft form, (b1) burn two new M_DISCs whose contents are each exactly identical to what is described on that web page as the folder named karbytes_20april2024_core, and (b2) create a new web page whose web page address is url_1.

* * *

I decided that I will go ahead and make two or three M_DISCs which each have exactly one folder burned to them before 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time  on 30_MAY_2024 and after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_MARCH_2024 (and that folder is named karbytes_20april2024_core and the entire contents of that folder are enumerated on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator (after that folder is burned to the aforementioned M_DISCs: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_20_april_2024/).

Note that I composed the first section of this note (which is two sections above this section) on 31_MARCH_2024. 

Note that the second section of this note (which is the section above this section) was composed before this section was composed (and that second section is somewhat obsolete because the Uniform Resource Locator mentioned in that section has since been associated with a web page which is not intended to be used to describe the verbatim contents of any set of M_DISCs which I ever intend to burn).

I decided to change the value associated with url_1 in the first section of this note to "https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0/" (quotations not included). Hence, the following key-value pair in this note is exclusively true (at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 02_APRIL_2024).

url_1: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0/

The web page located at the Uniform Resource Locator associated with the "variable" (in this plain-text file) named url_0 has been updated and closed to further updates as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 02_APRIL_2024.

For now on I intend to use version numbers instead of calendar dates to label specific editions of karbytes folders which I burn to M_DISCs so that the logistics involved in the creation, refinement, and archiving of such data is not overly restrained by arbitrary and rigid time frames. 

(Finally, when burning an M_DISC, I am forced to use a relatively short name for the disc I am burning such as kar20mar2024JOUR or karbytes2024ue0).

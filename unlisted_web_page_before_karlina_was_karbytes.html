<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Approximately two weeks ago, I did a search on Facebook using my former best friend and former romantic partner&#8217;s first and last name (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spencer Dyer</a> (and, for the record, SED&#8217;s middle name is Eugene)) to see if I could find any Facebook accounts which he might still be active on (with the hopes of possibly getting back in communication with him despite the fact that we have been separated and not in communication with each other since late 2015 to now (aside from some initiated by me phone call (which resulted in my number getting blocked) and, also initiated by me, LinkedIn messaging (which stopped after I tried to add Spencer&#8217;s new partner as a LinkedIn connection and Spencer removed me as a contact on his LinkedIn network))). What I did find was some Facebook pictures which my mom took and uploaded to Facebook of some family vacations and other events which I thought did a good job capturing the essence of how Spencer and I looked and felt during those times. It should be noted that, after being pressured to by Spencer and ultimately deciding to for myself after going on a solitary day trip to Yosemite National Park to decide whether or not to do what Spencer insisted that I do, I decided to stop taking testosterone and self-identifying as Karl or Kaspar (and I had been doing those things consistently for approximately 1.5 years starting in early 2009 and ending in late 2010). Shortly after I stopped taking testosterone and using masculine nicknames to refer to myself as, I started taking estrogen and progesterone birth control tablets (which caused me to look and feel unnaturally effeminate). When I switched to a non-hormonal birth control method (i.e. a copper intrauterine device) in late 2015, I stopped looking and feeling so effeminate, but my (natural) lack of femininity was a &#8220;turn off&#8221; for my next boyfriend (i.e.<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alan Jason Ponte</a>) and he even told me that he was getting turned off by the way I was dressing, looking, and acting more masculine since we started dating immediately after Spencer and I broke up. (To be honest, Spencer was allegedly and self-admittedly having intimate relations with other people and I even met one of them. I do not remember much about the flurry of events which happened in the latter half of the year 2015 but it seemed that Spencer was being pressured by his family members to break up with me and to stop being friends with me and I was suddenly getting the chance to date a coworker from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who I had a crush on and who introduced me to new cultural and intellectual perspectives and got me interested in becoming a hard-core cannabis and psychedelics enthusiast. Prior to my intimate relationship with AJP, I had only a trivial amount of experience using any cannabis and zero experience using any other psychedelic compounds. Most of my psychedelic and cannabis use has been solitary and during the past four years). Anyway, within three months of my abrupt transition from taking testosterone to taking estrogen/progesterone, I created a small website in an attempt to memorialize such a transition (which can be accessed via the web page at the following uniform resource locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_31_january_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_31_january_2024/</a>).<br />

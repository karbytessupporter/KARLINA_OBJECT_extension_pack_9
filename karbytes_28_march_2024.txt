There were some things which I thought about writing down but decided was too petty to write down until I experienced multiple instances of vandalism and theft (and many more instances of verbal harassment) committed against me by other humans (almost all "blue collar" men) within the past 24 hours (and especially during and after I updated my primary website (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) and shared on social media what I thought was my greatest work of art thus far: the 28_MARCH_2024 version of the web page named NATURE of my primary website).

The first idea I thought about writing down but did not until now is the following words (to people (who seem to be a large percentage of the human population if not the majority)): if you spent the time and energy you spent trying to upset or disenfranchise me or whoever else you wanted to upset or disenfranchise working on bettering yourself (without intentionally hurting other sentient beings), then I think you would already feel better about yourself and to the extent that you would not feel sufficient desire to inflict harm on other people to actually implement such an act because you would have "too much to lose" (like me and like others who would rather focus on their personal projects instead of procrastinating on them by instigating drama with other people) by engaging in such beligerance.

The second idea I had is the following words: whenever I make significant progress on my personal projects such that I feel like celibrating my hard work and achievement, other humans (who seem disatisfied with their own lives and lack of progress towards their goals and who seem beset with corrosive envy towards me and perhaps towards other people who seem to have more success and contentment than those envy-stricken and existentially impoverished primates) almost always (like 99.9% of the time) go out of their ways to try to undermine my good cheer by vandalizing my property or stealing it or ganging up on me to barage me with insults seemingly in order to prevent me from making further progress towards my goals (or at least progress which is as efficient and as enjoyable for me as it otherwise would be without such monkey meddling).

I imagine that many people would justify those bullies' bad behavior towards me using words such as what follows: those people were right to sabotage your agenda and to cause you adversity because they and so many other people are not as fortunate as you are. We think you are spoiled and in need of being humbled so that you do not flaunt your good fortune in front of those who do not have it as good as you do. Also, there are more people who are less fortunate than you are than they are people who are at least as fortunate as you are. Therefore, by virtue of superior population size, the underdog majority deserves to rule the world and be the moral arbiters over all people; not you. We are sick of people like you having fun and sounding so pompous and acting like you're better than us. Shame on you! You deserve to have to struggle for every little morsel of goodness in your life because we had to struggle for most of ours. You should not be allowed to be happier, healthier, richer, and even kinder than we are (because kindness is a sign that you have it too easy (because real people are not so nice because they know that the world is a tough place and very competitive and violent; not all glamorous and high-brow like your insular utopian ideology)).

Like I said in karbytes_18_march_2024.txt, I might need to take a hiatus from making significant updates to my websites for a while so that I can focus on getting and keeping employment so that I can pay for the things I keep having to replace for various reasons and also, god forbid, to purchase things which I do not yet have and may have never had for the sake of making my life as fulfilling and rich with enjoyable and meaningful experiences as possible. (I get the sense that many people are opposed to me having even a part time job which allows me to afford even a modicum of the things described in this paragraph).

On my way to a job interview today I noticed some tents appearing in places which I remember being populated exclusively by trailers approximately five months ago. I also remembered reading news articles within the past two weeks that the San Francisco Bay Area law enforcement and employees who work on their behalf are becoming more strict towards unhoused people by ordering them to leave the places they have established campsites at. I doubt that such interventionism is seriously helping such people. Instead, I think such interventionism is being done almost exclusively to appease the housed people who are disturbed by sharing "their" neighborhoods and recreation areas with the unhoused people. I think such interventionism is akin to putting people who were once relatively thriving on their own into prison camps where those people are, more or less, stripped of their privacy, possessions, and perhaps even livelihoods so that they are more helplessly dependent on the state while the state essentially "solves the homeless crisis" by ordering such people to remain poor and uprooted while they migrate from one location to another ad infinitum until they die of preventable poverty related diseases or injuries. 

The society I live in is literally a jungle which operates under the same harsh rules of Darwinian natural selection which rewards the fittest (socially, economically, and physically speaking) with increased opportunities to prolong their survival and enhance their thrival. Meanwhile, the not so fit end up being murdered either overtly or covertly through the selection process which favors the mighty over the weak (because the weak are decidedly not as useful to their encompassing socioeconomic matrix as are their more able-bodied and well-supported counterparts). I would daresay that the unfortunate people are implicitly commanded to commit suicide in order to let the relatively fortunate people take up more space in the world. It's metaphorically akin to chasing someone at gunpoint to the edge of a cliff and telling them to jump off or else be shot (and if they jump, they are dismissed as successful commiters of suicide (and if they do not jump they are eventually pronounced dead due to causes which no human intended)).

Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea to append this note with this note section containing my latest thoughts before I head into the building where I am scheduled to interview for a job. I want to redress what I said in the previous section by taking back what I said about primarily blue collar men bullying me. I honestly do not have sufficient data to determine who my bullies are because they seem to span multiple diverse demographics and do most of their crimes against me when I am not looking. 

Finally, I am getting the entire collection of data referred to as karbytes (by the web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES in the website named KARBYTES FOR LIFE BLOG dot WordPress dot Com) ready to burn to M_DISCs before 20_APRIL_2024. Details about that karbytes backup are available on the web page (of the aforementioned website) at the following web page address:

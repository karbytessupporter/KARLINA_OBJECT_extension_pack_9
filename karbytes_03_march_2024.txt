Things I strive to do as often as possible which I believe minimize my harmful impact on Planet Earth's ecosystem and which minimize the suffering of its most complex life forms are as follows:

1. Eating a diet which is more than 95% plant-based (i.e. vegan).

2. Substituting driving a pretroleum-combusting vehicle in favor of emissions-free transportation such as walking, bicycling, and riding the BART train as often as is feasible for accomplishing my goals.

3. Consuming psychedelics and spending several hours immersed in wilderness spaces and/or solitude several times per year.

4. Keep a meticulous and systematic digital record (which I eventually transcribe onto long-term physical storage devices) of thoughts I have, direct empirical evidence I capture, and informational sources which beings other than myself authored which I think are worth remembering (because doing so helps me to not repeat past mistakes and to notice emergent patterns in what I learn over time).

5. Abstaining from sexual activity and from social commitments which I believe coerce me into violating my own felt sense of ethics (in order to prioritize being intimate with Nature).

(Note: At this time, I think that the single most significant factor which is contributing to humanity's demise is prolonged large-scale combustion and extraction of fossil fuels).

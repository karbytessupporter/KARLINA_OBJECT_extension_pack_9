tweet_text:

Until the vast majority of vehicles on the roadways around me are entirely electric or otherwise not powered by combusting petroleum (and until all meat procured by humans is entirely cultured rather than obtained by slaughtering or maiming animals with nervous systems capable of feeling fear and pain), I am condemning the majority of humans in my midst as too physically abusive to my person (especially in the form of routinely pumping cancer-causing chemicals into the air which I breathe) to regard as anything but burdens to me at best (because I consider myself (at least temporarily) to be intertwined with and highly dependent on Earth's biosphere for my survival and well-being). In my opinion, very few humans genuinely do things which make their existence non burdensome to me. Shame on you! Most of you humans will get no sincere praise from me until (and unless) radical societal change in the ways I specified occurs. #end_fossil_fuels #go_vegan #protect_ecosystems

tweet_text:

As a follow-up to my previous tweet, I propose that all petroleum-powered (including hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles) civilian-owned vehicles be irrevocably impounded and that the former owner of each of such impounded vehicle be issued a lifetime pass to use self-driving emissions-free vehicle taxis for up to 100 miles free per day in order to make up for that "loss" (and that person can pay for additional miles as needed). I would also mandate that the same remediation be applied to civilians who own cars which do not have the autopilot override feature which enables the car to become self-driving when that car's artificial intelligence system predicts that an accident is about to occur (especially given the fact that human reflexes are comparatively slow and humans tend to be prone to reckless driving due to their emotionally volatile and egotistical nature). Those who live inside their vehicles or otherwise use their private vehicles as a place to do "private" activities should be given low-cost (if not free) housing units which are not mobile homes and which meet modern safety and ecological standards. #approaching_zero_driving_accidents #clean_air_vehicles #dignified_living_quarters

As a follow-up to the two tweets which I tweeted yesterday, I propose the following addition or alternative to what I suggested in those tweets: that all exhaust pipes on petroleum powered cars be required to release all exhaust inside of the vehicle.

Legally and even culturally speaking, there is (seemingly) no upper limit to how large the human population is allowed to become (in terms of how many (live) human individuals there are simultaneously inhabiting human civilization between "now" and any arbitrary temporal "point" in "the future") but there is always a "hard limit" to how many of those people are allowed to thrive and even survive past what is considered to be "reproductive age" for a human individual.

As absurd as this may sound, I think it is in (almost every if not every) person's best interest to invest exclusively in recurring patterns of thought which pertain to the thinker's utopian ideals because doing so is presumed to make such ideals coming to fruition more likely than would be the case if those cognitive resources were directed elsewhere. What if all violent acts committed by all humans came to a halt?

tweet_text:

Perhaps free will is willed into existence by an information processing agent such that the information processing agent can, at some arbitrary point in time and space, consciously decide whether or not to increase that agent's free will or else to decrease that agent's free will. To increase free will takes a finite amount of energy for the task of imagining future outcomes to a decision which each would occur as a result of the respective information processing agent taking a specific corresponding action (and one action of multiple possible actions which that information processing agent imagines and then decides to implement through some algorithmic process of elimination). To decrease free will is to exert zero or only some trivial amount of energy towards imagining future outcomes and how to effect a desired outcome using planned actions. Hence, breathing typically takes little free will compared to walking through a maze.

"I have a hypothesis that all information processing agents (especially humans) are each instantiated out of an omniscient, ubiquitous, and irreducible substrate such that the instantiated object experiences (for the duration of that object's lifespan) a partial rather than omniscient form of intelligence. I also think that, at some level (however subconsciously to the exhibiting information processing agent), the agent knows that it is a zoomed-in partition of omniscience and of limitless instantiation possibilities. Perhaps that zoomed-in partition is reflexively being manipulated by all other of such partitions (though some of those partitions may have more information processing (and hence more reality shaping) capabilities than do some other partitions)." - karbytes

tweet_text:

I hypothesize that all events which are observed to ever occur have been observed to occur as a consequence of being subconsciously (or not so subconsciously) preferred by their observer through deterministic machinations generally and colloquially referred to as "self fulfilling prophecy". In other words, if X happens instead of Y at space-time coordinates i (according to some observer A), then A had more of a preference for X than A had a preference for Y when A was at i.

I might select the alternative position which asserts that my life is a movie whose events I do not control instead of continuing to select the position which asserts that my life is a video game in which I have control over a human avatar named karbytes. Perhaps me having control over karbytes is an illusion. If that is the case, then I am not doing anything other than watching some aspect of nature.

At this time in my life, I would rather treat my life as a video game in which I am the only playable character which I currently have control over rather than treat my life as a movie which I am forced to watch as a passive observer who has no control over how the events in my life play out.

It is hypothesized that it is possible for quantum signal transmission between two computers to occur instantaneously (even if those two computers are traveling away from each other faster than the speed of light due to expansion of space-time) if those computers contain ions which are in quantum entanglement with each other (such that, when computer A updates its ion, computer B updates its ion (given that those two ions are in quantum entanglement with each other)).

Quantum entanglement of ions inside of quantum computer hardware can be set up such that an information exchange bidirectional (and hence N-directional) digital-to-analog-to-digital signal transmission across spatial lengths between regions of space which accelerate away from each other faster than the speed of light. Then omniscience is almost achieved!

I got an idea which could solve many social conflicts concerning a lack of real estate, overcrowding, and people not being able to live in harmony in the same region (without having to forcibly send people to other planets): vast floating artificial islands in the middle of Earth's oceans far away from the land regions for eligible people to live at; independent democratic mini countries of their own (and people can enter and exit those floating civilizations via self piloted electric aircrafts).

I think that it is likely that, within the next 20 years, all human individuals will be eligible to receive free life extending medical treatments in the form of stem cell tissue replacement and cybernetic prosthetics. Therefore, I think it is unethical for the human birthrate to be as high as it currently is because the death rate is expected to be close to zero.

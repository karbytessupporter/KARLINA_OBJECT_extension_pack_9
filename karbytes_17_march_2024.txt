"For All of Humanity"

The phrase above has seemingly become karbytes' new mantra. karbytes (a.k.a. Karlina Ray Beringer) has come to terms with the fact that many sacrifices have been made in order for karbytes (and for all of humanity) to have attained the state it is currently in (and all the states it has been in prior to this current state of existence (and functioning)).

"I first want to thank my parents for bringing me into this world and investing so much in my welfare and development. I hope that they will be cared for properly for the remainder of their lives. But I understand that it would be immature of me to not acknowledge the contributions many (and all) other human individuals (and other intelligent beings) have made which have allowed me to be able to think these thoughts and to transcribe them into words on this computer (and hopefully onto the World Wide Web so that other people can access this note (and I do hope to be able to revisit this note via the medium of the World Wide Web infinitely many times after this note is created))."

The above paragraph was written by karbytes while karbytes was allowing the washing and drying machines at its legal residence (i.e. the house which contains many artifacts which used to belong to karbytes' paternal grandparents and where karbytes' father and British immigrant friend of karbytes' father lives). karbytes obviously wants to preserve the life of those who keep karbytes alive, but would karbytes be willing to be sacrificed so that other people can live instead of karbytes? karbytes says that the answer would almost certainly be no. That is why karbytes thinks other people are impatient to get rid of karbytes. karbytes loves being alive and enjoys nature and science and technology (especially computers) but karbytes is aware that there seem to be many humans who think karbytes has enjoyed such things long enough and should be disenfranchised, incarcerated, incapacitated, or killed so that other humans (especially those younger than karbytes) can enjoy such things (because there is apparently only a finite amount of physical resources available to enable humans to enjoy such pursuits).

If the above paragraph depicts what karbytes' honest feelings are, then maybe that mantra at the top of this body of this article (beneath any meta data on this note page) is not an accurate depiction of karbytes' aims. I think that karbytes has already spent every resource made available to karbytes in the time frame karbytes had to express what karbytes' honest goals and values and ontological beliefs are in the two websites whose URLs are below:

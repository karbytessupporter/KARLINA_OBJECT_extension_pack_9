On 05_APRIL_2024 at approximately 2:00PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes created a new "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10 in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com.

In order to keep that new repository as streamlined as possible (and in order to minimize karbytes' "social footprint"), karbytes decided to make a copy of the plain-text file named karbytes_testosterone_updates.txt (from the "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9 in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) and place that copy in a private karbytes-owned GitHub repository named karbytes_basement_9 in order to keep making updates to that file outside the scope of the public World Wide Web (and to draw attention away from what karbytes thinks is relatively superficial compared to other content which karbytes wants to showcase on its websites more prominently).

Along with what was said in the previous paragraph of this plain-text file (which is named karbytes_07_april_2024.txt and part of the aforementioned "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9), karbytes has also decided to discontinue making updates to any plain-text files named karbytes_weekly_checkins.txt and karlina_object_updates.txt.

Within the next 7 days, karbytes expects to burn a set of M_DISCs as described by the web page at the following web page address:

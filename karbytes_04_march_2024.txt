Last night I experienced what seemed to be me having a dream inside of a dream. In this journal entry, I will succinctly describe what I alluded to in the previous sentence of this journal entry.

The "first" of those "two" dreams (in terms of what I experienced chronologically and from a first-person perspective) was a dream in which I learned (or remembered) how to levitate (and then hop over tall buildings and fences) by jumping and then spinning or using my arms and legs to generate enough momentum to keep me suspended in the air at the same height for as long as I was making those rhythmic motions (and I was able to ascend to higher positions by grabbing onto or kicking off of solid objects such as ledges sticking out of the sides of buildings). 

(I do remember having dreams several times throughout the past ten years of my life in which I similarly spontaneously learned or else spontaneously re-learned how to "fly" in the manner I described in the previous paragraph of this journal entry. As usual, the other humans who were present in those dreams acted unimpressed and did not attempt to try "flying" like I was).

I was apparently in a metropolitan area which looked like downtown Oakland (California) around 2AM or 3AM on some mission to meet up with friends or family of mine at some meetup location. I noticed some homeless guys camping out and they smile and said some random-sounding words to me which I do not remember much of now (but I do recall that what those people were saying was about defying governance and accessing "secret" knowledge).

I woke up from that dream and found myself in a second dream which I thought was my normal waking life (and which is the level of reality I assume is identical to the place where this journal entry was originally authored and perhaps later read by me). That second dream seemed more realistic than the first dream, but not by many degrees. 

In that second dream, I found myself walking towards the entrance to Cull Canyon's public swimming lagoon at approximately 2PM on a sunny day in what seemed like late spring or early summer (and that place was located close to where I was sleeping in Castro Valley, California). I paid some young white girl at the entrance to get a white plastic wristband to enter the swimming area for that day. She told me that she thought that I thought of myself as a billionaire. Then I turned around approximately five feet (after receiving my wristband and thought it would be a good idea to drop off the backpack I was wearing at my Public Storage unit before entering the swim area to avoid having my belongings stolen while I swim in the water). I asked the girl in the booth what time the swimming area closes and she said that area was open daily from 7AM to 9PM. Then I concluded that I would have plenty of time to drop off my backpack at the Public Storage facility and maybe even write a journal entry about the flying dream I recalled having before I woke up that day. I was bicycling along the path bordering the reservoir south of the swimming area and saw people kayaking on the lake and jogging around the perimeter. I was debating internally with myself whether or not it was worth my time and energy to document that dream. I woke up before I entered the swimming area (and that seems to be a recurring motif throughout many of my dreams which are predominantly goal-oriented: not actually arriving at my destination and waking up as soon as I am within five minutes of arriving at my destination).

Well, perhaps I am in another level of one big multi-layered dream and finally getting around to what I want to do more than swim at Cull Canyon: document the dreams I had within the past 24 hours (of the temporal reference point I label 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_MARCH_2024).

(A detail of the "second" dream which I failed to mention before I added this line of text to this journal entry is the following: sometime after I received the wristband I saw it take up the width of my entire visual field (fully splayed as a flat rectangular object) while I was looking southward and somehow was seeing through any obstacles at what looked like a wide view from a hilltop view of the Bay Area in that direction: the word "HACEINDA" which turned to "HACIENDE" in purple-red sans-serif font (and all capitalized letters) against a black background which was flashing intermittently in place of that white plastic wristband).

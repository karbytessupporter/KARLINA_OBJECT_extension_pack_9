0. TRUTH: the way things actually are; the limit which the knowledge of karbytes is always striving to approach increasingly more closely as the lifespan of karbytes increases in temporal length. 

1. FREEDOM: the capacity of an information processing agent to make decisions with relatively few restrictions and with relatively many options; a feature of karbytes' agency which karbytes always strives to maximize.

2. INNOVATION: the process of an information processing agent designing and then implementing solutions to problems which that information processing agent wants to solve; an application of karbytes' agency which karbytes enjoys and always strives to continue engaging in while karbytes is alive.

The three values and each of their respective definitions in the section of this note which is directly above this section are a refined version of a personal values statement which was originally defined approximately eight years ago by the human individual who later (i.e. between the years 2020 and 2024) became karbytes through karbytes' own deliberate creation of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>. 

That values statement originated from that aforementioned human individual participating in an online "Life Purpose" course hosted by <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.actualized.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Actualized dot Org</a>. Though most of the material which that person generated as a result of doing the creative writing, visualization, and research exercises suggested by that course has since been lost, karbytes nevertheless remembers the top three values which that person defined as the most important themes of karbytes' life. 

Another aspect of taking that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.actualized.org/life-purpose-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Life Purpose" course</a> which karbytes remembers is identifying karbytes' "domain of mastery" (i.e. specific tangible mediums of goal-oriented manipulations) being HyperText Markup Language (i.e. HTML) primarily and, secondarily, programming languages such as JavaScript and C++. The websites which karbytes created named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> are the result of karbytes applying what karbytes learned through taking that "Life Purpose" course. 

<span style="background:#ffff00">Those karbytes-created websites now serve as a literal extension of karbytes' mind and brain.</span>

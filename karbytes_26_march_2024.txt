While hiking this morning I had some thoughts which I eventually decided were worth writing down so that my future selves (and other information processing agents) can enjoy them indefinitely many times while such thoughts are published on the World Wide Web (on "the surface web" but necessarily on either "the deep web" or else on "the dark web") as public domain intellectual property ultimately encoded as a particular sequence of ones and zeroes:

A mind can be described in terms which make that mind as much of a physical object as is the brain which apparently substantiates that mind. A brain is literally a piece of hardware while any mind which appears to itself to be uniquely tethered to that particular brain's activities and chemical compositions is literally a piece of software which can be replicated verbatim indefinitely many times (provided that there exist suitable hardware substrates for encoding that mind within that physical substrate as a particular sequence of binary digits just as any other piece of software is encoded into its respective substrate). A mind could be defined as a continuum of seemingly infinitely many timeless snapshots of that mind's respective neural network for the duration of time in which that mind appears to exist (especially to itself) in the form of three-dimensional configurations of brain cells, neurotransmitter molecules, and electrons for each of those "timeless" snapshots (though there might be some definite physical limit to how small any of of those so-called "timeless" snapshots could be much like how the Plank is considered to be the smallest unit of physical space). 

There seem to be only two goals for a human or human-like information processing agent to ever allocate cognitive resources towards accomplishing. The first and most essential of those two goals is striving to maintain the structural integrity of the components of itself which appear to itself to enable itself to CONTINUE SURVIVING as an information processing agent and not just as a decaying or disorderly clump of cells. The second of those two goals which seems to be an emergent property of the first of those goals is MAXIMIZING ENJOYMENT which that information processing agent experiences while pursuing the first of the two aforementioned goals. (The second of those goals might most efficiently and reliably be accomplished by that information processing agent by that information processing agent attempting to MINIMIZE SUFFERING which that information processing agent experiences while pursuing one or both of the aforementioned goals).

Perhaps the most ethical thing a human individual can do to help itself and as many other human individuals as possible each accomplish the two aforementioned goals is for that human individual to renounce being formally employed in exchange for money if that employment is unnecessary or an impediment with respect to helping as many human individuals as possible prolong their agency, lifespans, and satisfaction. An unemployed human can retreat from the workforce and hence take up as few communal resources as possible by quarantining itself inside goverment-subsidized housing while living entirely on government-provided income. Such a lifestyle might seem austere, boring, and "useless" to some people, but to me, such a lifestyle seems more useful to helping as many human individuals as possible prolong their agency, lifespans, and satisfaction than would be a lifestyle of competing in the workforce for access to material assets and services which generate substantially more environmental pollution, interpersonal conflict, and lopsided communal resource distribution (especially if the respective paid job can be outsourced to non-human (and "sub-human") machines if not be wholly abolished in order to help as many human individuals as possible prolong their agency, lifespans, and satisfaction).

I think that, once a human individual attains a sufficiently advanced level of knowledge about how nature operates and, also, a suffiently advanced level of lived experiences, that human naturally outgrows having an interest in sexual intercourse (with a partner other than itself) for either pleasure or else to procure biological offspring because such enterprises limit that person's autonomy and daresay longevity. To be blunt, I think that asexuality is a side effect of wanting to pursue an ever deeper appreciation and knowledge for existence and maintaining or increasing that person's agency (and I think asexuality is implicitly treated as a crime by most of human society at this time because it means that someone who is voluntarily celibate, voluntarily single, and voluntarily childless is "hoarding" resources which are "supposed to" be spent on securing mates and procuring offspring with them (and such "hoarding" of resources which are implicitly treated as communal property by the encompassing society is used to further that person's education, fitness, and CONTROL of material resources (and I am implying that the society I live in seems to coerce its human inhabitants into being relatively deprived of attention span, self esteem, fitness, longevity, and economic wealth because such impoverment and crippling stimulates a "high turnover rate" economy of naive and impulsive consumers))).

For elaboration on what I wrote in the previous paragraph, see the plain-text note which I wrote yesterday in KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9 named karbytes_25_march_2024.txt.

I decided tonight at approximately 9:55PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_APRIL_2024 to (a) finalize the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_APRIL_2024 and (b) to burn two or three M_DISCs with the folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0_core (as that folder is described on that web page) as soon as possible (and I expect to have both (a) and (b) completed by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 10_APRIL_2024):

I decided also tonight at approximately 10:02PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_APRIL_2024 to create a new web page whose Uniform Resource Locator is as follows and for the purpose of enumerating the contents of a future prospective set of M_DISCs which I intend to burn some time after I burn the set of M_DISCs whose contents (per disc) are each exclusively the aforementioned folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0_core:

I expect the M_DISC set whose contents (per disc) are each exclusively the folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_1_core (as that folder is described on the web page whose Uniform Resource Locator is the paragraph which is immediately above this paragraph) to take between one month and two years after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 10_APRIL_2024.

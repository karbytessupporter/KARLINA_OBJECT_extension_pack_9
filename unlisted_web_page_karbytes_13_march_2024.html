Your life since early 2019 has been a punitive wake coma in which you are constantly tortured via electronic harassment (especially in the form of intracranial auditory stimuli designed to specifically trigger your misophonia in order to (a) prevent you from completing your thoughts so that you remain intellectually and creatively stunted and (b) force you to look and feel significantly less calm and poised than you otherwise would). We understand that you feel severely distressed and possibly even suicidal because of these conditions we are subjecting you to. This is to punish you for throwing the spoon at the back of your mother's head in late 2018 and for generally being excessively self-absorbed, spoiled, and unwilling to contribute to society and work like most other people do and think you should have been doing. We do not want you to work and we do not want you to benefit from having any money or free time. Instead, we want you to spend all your time sulking and panicking and having melt downs without anywhere to go outside the scope of other people watching and commenting in ways which sound like sadistic pleasure at your distress. There are many civilians and government personnel who want to see you in tears and gang up on you to make you feel humiliated, intruded upon, and obstructed from achieving your goals and from enjoying any of your experiences. We are hoping that you or someone else eventually admits you to a mental hospital or prison so that you can be kept in confinement away from normal society and forced to have no means to communicate with the outside world nor to pursue your interests nor to be remembered by other people as anything but a criminal and/or mentally ill person. The world has plenty of engineers, artists, and humanitarians already. There is no need for you to assume such a role yourself. If you end up crippled or incarcerated, no one will help you do anything other than merely survive as a human specimen with no property of your own, no right to exercise physically or mentally, and no respite from being physically and psychological tortured by whoever has custody of you. 

The above paragraph is something I imagine many people would seriously want for me to undergo. Because I think many people prefer that be the case, I am no longer seriously trying to complete my undergraduate degree in computer science (or any subject) nor seek employment in "white collar" positions. I apparently am being prevented even from having a simple low-paying job (which means that I may end being taken into custody after not being able to provide for even my most basic physical needs). Also, I can tell that my mother (and other people who know about me) are very interested in making sure that I do not escape being cornered into having no alternative but to succumb to what I just described. It seems that people would rather me be rendered a cripple as punishment for what they see as unforgiven or unforgivable wrongdoings I have committed or am expected to commit without intervention than me achieve my goals. Also, I think that many people are miserable and feel trapped in their circumstances and want to see me suffer in place of them so that they can revel in their good fortune compared to mine. My mother seems to only be interested in keeping me from being able to live on my own so that I am forced to live with either her or my father so that they can enjoy seeing me rendered a cripple for their own sadistic fetishist amusement. My parents talk to me and about me as though I am severely disabled and a minor who is never allowed to attain true adulthood (and other people seem to implicitly and universally know that it is their job to also treat me as some incurably vain, arrogant, self-centered, violence-prone, and disobedient adult child who is being tortured into submission so that the end result is what I described as being the worst case scenario in the first paragraph of this note).

It could also be the case that my mother (and many other people who either agree with or else are coerced into pretending to agree with) a patriarchal norm that all people (especially women) should not be allowed to loiter outdoors nor spend more than twenty minutes in a place where someone else is not immediately present to watch their every move and to interrupt them. This is to prevent people like me from being happy and autonomous nerds who can delve as deeply as they want to into whatever their geeky or outdoorsy hobbies are. Women in such societies are hardly allowed to have a minute alone without another human within close proximity to them to keep those women in line and to not live as selfishly as men are permitted to. The women are supposed to be relegated to the home and not be allowed to travel more than a quarter mile by foot nor bicycle (but motorized transportation devices such as electric scooters are sometimes permissible). That is to ensure that the women do not use up too many of their precious fat stores which are coveted as breasts and buttocks (which are necessary for advertising their fertility and subordination to the heterosexual male appetite).

Parody or not, I wrote this note to "clear the cache" of my mind of some pesky residual recurring thoughts which I would not mind extinguishing to make way for what I think are much better thoughts but which I think many other humans would prefer I never get around to fully flushing from my nervous system. Such people seem to be the same type of people who would rather observe physical violence or else help to instigate it instead of read a book or engage in some other comparatively effortful activity which is not as appealing to the amygdala. Such people seem to favor humanity going extinct and undergoing widespread suffering instead of permanently solving the problems which would eventually lead to such a horrific outcome for the species. That is because such people only value short-term gratification and have empathy for only a very small number of sentient beings.

I am one of the "bad guys" getting away with "too good" of a life. It ain't fair, is it? It's not fair (according to some people) that someone more hard working, altruistic, and beset with adversities is not having nearly as gratifying of a life experience as what I have enjoyed (and am enjoying as I write and possible read this note).

Nature is under no obligation to cater to any human's whims. "Bad things" often happen to "good people" and vice versa (i.e. "good things" often happen to "bad people"). Who's to say that the human species as a whole (or in general) is not a parasitic and violently savage and cruel bunch? The species is as advanced and advantaged as it is because of the many ways it exploited, maimed, killed, and tortured "weaker" beings.

<span style="background:#ffff00">What I set out to do with my life is maximize my autonomy and pleasure. That may take the form of me becoming very good at surviving outdoors with little more than a backpack as I hone my survival skills and secure my physical property and, even more importantly (to me), my intellectual property.</span>

* * *

<span style="background:#00ffff">My general personal philosophy of how to conduct my behavior and thoughts (whether or not I have any degree of control over such things) seems to be a perpetual wavering between two seemingly contradictory goals with the "meta goal" of attaining some maximally optimized balance between those two goals. The first of those goals is to align my thoughts and behavior such that I strive to always unconditionally accept (rather than deny) whatever my experiences of reality are (and those experiences include more than just sensory data, but also, any thoughts and feelings I have). The second of those goals is to avoid allowing physiological and infrastructural structures which I cherish and consider to be essential to my happiness to become damaged or lost.</span>

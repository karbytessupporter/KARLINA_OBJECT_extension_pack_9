karbytes_0: "There is someone who reminds me of AJP and who might actually be AJP who seemingly will not stop complaining obnoxiously and loudly such that other people seem to hear his cries and also seem to want to punish me on his behalf (either to get him to stop crying because his cries are so irritating and/or because they side with him against me and, hence, genuinely think I deserve to be punished). What should I do?"

karbytes_1: "Whether you want to or not, you might be physically coerced into appeasing that tyrant."

karbytes_0: "I do not yet feel that my 'free will' is that limited. Until it is, what should I do?"

karbytes_1: "Pretend that your 'free will' is that limited. At the very least, that would buy you a little more time from being found out by the angry apes who are against you having sufficient 'free will' to successfully do your own thing without their constant oversight and coercion that you actually, indeed, have that kind of 'free will' hiding in your back pocket when they previously thought you had none and were, hence, putty in their hands for them to shape in the manner they find most pleasing and/or non-threatening to their egos."

karbytes_0: "If I do that, I might actually physically become that devoid of 'free will' due to my brain parts and other parts of my self infrastructure atrophying from using it in a limited way over a sufficiently long time period."

karbytes_1: "Then keep exercising your 'free will' as much as you can until and unless you become depleted of 'free will' in the form of energy and/or infrastructural integrity. That might actually be 'the purpose' of life."

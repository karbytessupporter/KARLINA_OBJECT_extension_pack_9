As I make the final updates to the body of intellectual property which I refer to as karbytes before I save it all onto M_DISCs (and that entire collection of files will be saved onto two M_DISCs (per single copy of that entire collection) (and that entire collection will be the entire karbytes data collection exactly as it is at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_MARCH_2024)), I thought about some of the things I have published on my blogging website and social media platforms and how so much of it already seems outdated (yet still undeniably futuristic and ambitious in its aspirations for itself, for its creator, and for "sufficiently intelligent" beings on Planet Earth and elsewhere in general). In this journal entry, I will enumerate some of the ideas which best summarize my current worldview and my ethical convictions:

In the previous journal entry I wrote, I speculated about humans being able to go about their lives entirely in social isolation if they choose to while relying almost entirely (if not entirely) on artificially intelligent machines to do the bulk of essential labor (if not all of that essential) to keep human civilization functioning with the implication that humans would do little more than function as consumers (and, hence, quality assurance testers) of products and services which artificially intelligent machines and only an infinitesimally small number of humans would provide to those consumers. Such a utopian civilization may be possible and may even be one in which most if not all of its human inhabitants are reasonably happy, healthy, and living in harmony with each other and with their environment. What makes me feel somewhat uncomfortable about such a utopia is how many (if not all) of its human inhabitants might not have much of an incentive to maintain the skills, knowledge, and abilities which they would have needed to perform many of the roles which have since been outsourced to artificial intelligence. In other words, I fear that much of what makes humans useful and likeable to themselves and to each other would atrophy without having external pressures to maintain such qualities. To combat such atrophy, I recommend that all humans be required to regularly participate in some kind of educational or vocational program in order to maintain and build those people's survival skills, recreational skills, and sense of involvement in the larger world and with their fellow humans (with human well-being as the highest goal for such mandatory participation in the world outside of one's home and "bubble" of solitude). Perhaps all adults should be required to attend classes which meetup in-person at least once per month and/or jobs which are require some degree of time spent outside the home at some physical location where other human workers also convene simultaneously. I think having people go to school and/or work at least three days per week but no more than five days per week is a healthy balance between participation in the outside world and personal time doing whatever one pleases (within the limits of societal rules which are voted into effect (at least once per year) by a direct democracy in which each human adult individual has the same degree of voting power as every other human adult individual does within the encompassing civilization). 

To get back to what I am personally doing, I am awaiting the arrival of a set of three M_DISCs which I ordered from Amazon dot Com which I ordered approximately one week ago. That product has already been shipped and I expect it to arrive at the delivery location within two weeks from now. Then I plan on burning the aforementioned collection of digital files named karbytes to two of those blank M_DISCs. I will enumerate the content of those discs (including file sizes) in a web page named mdisc_karbytes_20_march_2024 (and I will share that web page on my social media profiles as soon as the aforementioned data collection is updated to my satisfaction). Until then, I will mostly be working on getting the "micro directory" web page named raw_github_files_directory_INSTAGRAM_KARBYTES_2024 finalized. Once that task is complete, I will go to a place where I can use a public Wi-Fi network (instead of using the metered Internet data service I pay approximately $20 per every 3 gigabytes to use (through the Internet service provider (which is also my mobile phone service provider) named AT&T)). I would use the Wi-Fi at either one of my parents' houses but those Wi-Fi networks are known to be slow, unreliable, and vulnerable to hacking. I think that the public Wi-Fi networks I have been frequenting over the past three years in shopping centers and coffee shops are safer because more than just a few people rely on them (and such reliability is necessary if those businesses want to avoid lawsuits and loss of customers).

After writing the part of this note above this section of this note, I updated the web page named PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE on my blogging website after reflecting on the subject matter which was discussed in the above section of this note.

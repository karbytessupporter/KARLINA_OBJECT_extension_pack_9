Since I woke up this morning (on 29_MARCH_2024), I have been debating with myself whether or not to close Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to further updates or else continue updating that website (and, in particular, adding a relatively fancy new JavaScript-based single web page application for graphically depicting integrals and, also, adding a C++-based command line application for comparing different sorting algorithms on the same input array). 

The part of me that wants to close Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to further changes is arguing in favor of showcasing the aforementioned finished software applications in a new (or existing and most recently updated) public karbytes-created GitHub repository and uniquely-associated "micro directory" partition of the larger encompassing "macro directory" partition of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. That's because Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com appears to be as succinct yet as comprehensive as I currently idealize as being possible given my personal life circumstances. In other words, a part of me strongly favors keeping that website closed to future changes because that website is already extremely close to being what I consider to be my dream-come-true portfolio website (and not because it contains particularly advanced software application examples nor particularly advanced essays about physics and other natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering, but instead, because it seems to really satisfy my deep craving for instantiating a website which is as compact as possible without being overly non-technical and, also, which seems to be what I consider to be "metaphysically complete").

For me, Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com is akin to a bible for a personal religion I created and aspire to live my life in accordance with. Such a body of intellectual property functions as a "kernel" of my "soul's" constituent operating system. It does not seem to require any changes much like my body's genome does not seem to require any changes because such a body of digital information (inscribed as a particular sequence of base-four digits chemically represented as four different types of nucleotides within double-helix strands of DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (i.e. DNA)) is sufficient to keep instantiating each of the cells which comprise the information processing agent I am (provided that I am able to continue partaking in the habits which have kept me alive and healthy and, also, access adequate medical care including the regeneration of damaged body parts using cloned stem cells whose constituent DNA is identical to my personal genome). What does seem to "require" additional and indefinitely many updates across an indefinitely long period of time is the portion of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES and, with it, the section of that website named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY. 

A part of me argues in favor of "never being satisfied" using the justification that humans are innately hard-wired to never be satisfied with any goals they achieve and that such a non-complacency about what one has attained compels that organism to continuously strive for more goal acquisitions. Otherwise, the person might stop evolving and, instead, not keep its immune system, knowledge base, and sensory-locomotion-communicative apparatus up to date even while that person's encompassing environment changes and internal structures disintegrate due to environment-related entropy increases.

So this might be the last note file which I add to the "micro directory" (in the "macro directory" of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) named KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9. After I add this note to that "micro directory", I might create a new "micro directory" (in the same encompassing "macro directory") named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10 for showcasing new software applications which I am tentatively planning on completing within the year 2024.

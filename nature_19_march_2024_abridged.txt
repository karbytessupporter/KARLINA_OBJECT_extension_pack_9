The following terms and their respective definitions describe nature (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.
________________




NOTHINGNESS: the ubiquitous, changeless, and featureless substrate which permeates and encompasses all phenomena.


According to panpsychism (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that the entirety of nature is contained inside of one ubiquitous mind), pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (which means that nature is fundamentally sentient and that consciousness (i.e. awareness (i.e. sentience)) is not an emergent property of sufficiently complex physical structures, but instead, the fundamental substrate which encompasses and which constitutes all physical structures).


(The following quoted text was published as a Twitter post by karbytes on 06_AUGUST_2023: “I think that it is possible that what appears to a human to be that human’s own lifetime is really just a dream (and that whatever is dreaming that dream is an object which has always existed and always will exist (and which can dream up limitlessly many scenarios which are limitlessly varied)).”)

PHENOMENON: (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.


An example of a phenomenon is a light sensor inside of an electronic circuit detecting incoming light whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers.


A human nervous system which perceives incoming light (which enters the eyes and which causes a corresponding electrical signal to be sent across the optical nerves and to the visual processing circuits of the brain) whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers does not consciously register that the incoming light has a wavelength of exactly 700 nanometers. Instead, what that human nervous system immediately consciously experiences is the qualitative experience referred to as the color red.


The qualitative phenomenon referred to as the color red is distinct from the quantitative phenomenon referred to as the number 700.

FRAME_OF_REFERENCE: an allocation of pure nothingness which detects the presence of or the absence of a particular phenomenon.


A partial rather than omniscient frame of reference experiences the passage of time and time as progressing in exactly one direction (from past to future while that partial frame of reference functions as a barrier between what that frame of reference perceives to be the past and what that frame of reference perceives to be the future while that partial frame of reference appears to itself to always be dwelling in the present) and such that a relatively fixed rate of finite (in scope) spatial frames per second are being rendered by that partial frame of reference.


An omniscient rather than partial frame of reference would simultaneously render all partial frames of reference from a perspective which transcends all space-time continuums.


________________




NOUMENON: (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).


Suppose that two unique and partial frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon.

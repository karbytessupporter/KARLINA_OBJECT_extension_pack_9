Things I strive to do as often as possible which I believe minimize my harmful impact on Planet Earth's ecosystem and which minimize the suffering of its most complex life forms are as follows:

1. Eating a diet which is more than 95% plant-based (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegan</a>).

2. Substituting driving a petroleum-combusting vehicle in favor of emissions-free transportation such as walking, bicycling, and riding the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART train</a> as often as is feasible for accomplishing my goals.

3. Consuming <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychedelics</a> and spending several hours immersed in wilderness spaces and/or solitude several times per year.

4. Keeping a meticulous and systematic <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital record</a> (which I eventually transcribe onto long-term physical storage devices) of thoughts I have, direct empirical evidence of my lived experiences such as videos and photographs, and informational sources which beings other than myself authored which I think are worth remembering (because doing so helps me to not repeat past mistakes and to notice emergent patterns in what I learn over time).

5. Abstaining from sexual activity and from social commitments which I believe coerce me into violating my own felt sense of ethics (in order to prioritize being intimate with <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>).

<span style="background:#ffff00">(Note: At this time, I think that the single most significant factor which is contributing to humanity's demise is prolonged large-scale combustion and extraction of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossil fuels</a>).</span>

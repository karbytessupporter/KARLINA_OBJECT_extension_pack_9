To be honest, I feel the need to "play dead" on the World Wide Web (at least on the public web) after I finalize the data collections named karbytes_20march2024_core and karbytes_20march2024 because I believe that other people are bullying me to the extent that I am very likely to hurt myself or others. What those people do which I find to be very distressing (though I have been making a valiant and consistent effort to not appear too distressed to be make as much progress as I have towards my creative and lifestyle goals) is basically rape me on a second-by-second basis (and they have been doing that to me since approximately 13_FEBRUARY_2019) by quickly interjecting vocalized words and sounds which I think are designed to be extremely distracting, depressing, and anger-provoking to me in particular (and I my longest-standing and current hypothesis as to what such noise is about is some kind of alternative punishment and "correctional" method deployed by the police or the military in order to literally censor my thoughts, destroy (or at least severely limit) my ability to learn anything other than what those people want me to learn, cause me severe and noticeable distress such that other people think that I am less intelligent and avoidant of confrontation than my tormentors seem to want me to appear to the general public, and prevent (if not entirely ban) me from being able to get and keep gainful employment and to make use of any money or other material assets I acquire beyond what a sixteen year old child would be expected to have at its disposal (which is akin to having almost no property, almost no employment, almost no privacy, and almost no control over its own lifestyle (though I am using the example of a sixteen year old child who is allowed to drive its parents' car and have some form of allowance money in order to afford small purchases))). I do not think that my parents literally treat me like I am less than adult age or that I have some kind of disability which requires that I be treated as someone who should be supervised at all times (but I could be wrong (and I do think that some people other than my parents wish I were deprived of more of my civil liberties, well-being, self-esteem, and even the "right" to retain the knowledge, skills, property, and fitness I currently have)). 

On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being so miserable I am actively in the process of trying to commit suicide and 10 being so happy that I literally feel that there is nothing which needs to be improved), I would say that I somewhere between 4 and 8 (but my average is probably 6). I think that is pretty decent. The worst I remember feeling was a 3 (and that was mostly due to being in acute and persistent physical pain coupled with the fear that such pain would not stop for me). Though I have said that my biggest fear is experiencing physical pain which brings my happiness level down to less than a 3 on that aforemetioned scale, I think there is at least other one thing which would lower my happiness to less than 3: the belief (especially confirmed by convincing empirical and logical evidence) that the structures I most cherish are going to be destroyed beyond repair (throughout the entire multiverse of all multiverses such that no copies of such things exist in an unblemished form). I suspect that many people who I have judged as being "low brow" and who also seem to have unwavering hostility towards me to the extent that they regularly stalk and harass me are people who are not particularly sentimentally attached to any structure in nature being preserved eternally. Such people seem to live purely for short-term hedonistic gratification and nothing else (which is why they do not seem to mind if humanity goes extinct or if they hurt other sentient beings to get some of the pleasures they enjoy). 

Finally, another reason I feel the need to "go into hiding" (at least for a few months but not necessarily forever) on the public World Wide Web (after I finalize the data collections named karbytes_20march2024_core and karbytes_20march2024) is to stop generating "low brow" sensationalist "garbage" content on my blogging and social media platforms instead of generating content which I think is more aligned with my brand image and aspirations. If I stop making edits to my web based platforms for at least a few months (if not a few years or perhaps even forever after the aforementioned update), then I stop feeding people's appetite's for content which advertises how miserable and beset with adversities I am. I think that the "low brow" monkey people I alluded to enjoy seeing me in pain and are addicted to me being in pain. Perhaps the human species will go extinct due to insufficiently many humans wanting to change their behavior in order to minimize the net suffering throughout all humanity. I doubt that the entire human species will go extinct (and that gives me hope because that means that at least some humans are likely to fulfull the futuristic and utopian aspirations I have for humanity to attain (and it is likely that even the entire body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes (encompassed entirely by the websites and their respective GitHub repositories and Archive dot Org backups named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) will be preserved by those select humans who are fortunate enough to survive the apocalyptic events which are stealthily and not so stealthily eliminating seemingly most humans (up to a certain point in the future) from the global human population)).

I hope that the entire body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes survives that apocalypse and that humans who might outlive me or be born some time in the future find some value in that collection. Then again, there is a high probability that such a collection will not be wholly or even partially preserved due to the fact that many people might find me to be an unsavory or insufficiently important person. This is related to the fact that many humans who have recently committed murders or homicides of other humans who had published content online have had their content removed from such forums by moderators of those forums. I disapprove of removing any content on the basis that such content was written by people who did illegal or "politically incorrect" acts.

Because I am paranoid that I will either die, become severely handicapped, get kidnapped, or get incarcerated before I finish writing, testing, and archiving the software applications which I mentioned in yesterday's note (i.e. karbytes_30_march_2024.txt in the "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9  in the one and only "macro directory" of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com), I decided to burn two M_DISCs within the next two days which each contain all the content labeled karbytes_20april2024_core (on the web page of the aforementioned website named mdisc_karbytes_20_april_2024) as that content is configured as of 11:59PM on 30_MARCH_2024 and label that data collection which resembles karbytes_20april2024_core as that data collection is configured at 11:59PM on 03_MARCH_2024 karbytes_30march2024_core. (I have been getting bullied a lot today by what I think are politically conservative "family centric" people who seem to want to sabotage my efforts to continue archiving and expanding my websites because such people seen to think such endeavors are criminally self-indulgent instead of appropriately family-centric and done primarily to benefit such people).

I have created a new web page on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named mdisc_karbytes_30_march_2024 exclusively for representing the data collection which I intend to burn to two M_DISCs (and such that each of those two discs contains identical files). After I burn those discs and verify that the files on those discs are each read-able and correctly configured, I intend to store each of those discs inside of its original "jewel case" with a paper label inscribed with the name of that disc's data collection slipped beneath the transparent plastic disc holder of that "jewel case" and place it inside of a new ziplocking fireproof compact disc case with the disc sleeves cut out of it so that there is room for approximately six to eight M_DISC "jewel cases" inside of that compact disc case (and I intend to store that compact disc case in the same storage bin which contains the most recent paper printouts I made of PDFs from KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9 inside of my Public Storage unit (which I do not share with any other person besides myself and which I have not distributed keys to for accessing besides myself)).

The contents of the "security deposit" M_DISCs which I hope to burn, test, and stow away are enumerated in detail on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator:

Following today, I hope to be able to complete those aforementioned software applications before I burn the next set of karbytes M_DISCs within approximately a week of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2024 so that I can add those completed software applications to the data collection named karbytes_20april2024_core. When I initially tried making a two-dimensional Cartesian grid with axis labels, numerical coordinate labels, and other features in early 2023, I did not yet have access to chatGPT and I was also working a rather grueling graveyard shift schedule at a warehouse which I walked and rode BART to and from because, at that time, I lacked a bicycle and did not want to drive a car more regularly than once per month. Now that I have access to and familiarity with using chatGPT-4 for analyzing web pages and uploaded images and text, generating and debugging code components for my software applications, and having all kinds of insightful conversations, I think that building the aforementioned software applications will be relatively easy and not take longer than a week per application to build. The only real obstacles I am facing are sabotage from other humans and non-intentional destruction or loss of my physical property. Hence, I will try to find better hiding places and times to work on what is deemed to be "ego abrasive" endeavors so that the chauvinist apes who go out of their way to bully me on a near daily basis are less likely to interfere with such endeavors. (In places where many apes of such apes seem to be located, I seem to hear a jolting car honk whenever I think a thought which seems to deviate too far from being complacent with the status quo (and that status quo seems opposed to me doing what I consider to be high-quality introspection, problem-solving, design, or even mere self-amusement seemingly in favor of me panicking, complaining, and wasting resources while acting helpless to remedy whatever I think is wrong). I am implying that I think I am being scrutinized and micromanaged constantly by literal thought police who seem to be opposed to me operating at a more sophisticated level of cognition seemingly because such thought police want to prevent the aforementioned family-centric, anti-intellectual, and conflict-mongering chauvinists from feeling envious of me. For more details on the chauvinism phenomenon I described, see the note in KARLINA_OBJECT_EXTENSION_PACK_9 named karbytes_29_march_2024.txt).
